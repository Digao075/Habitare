Habitare: Shoppable Design Ecosystem 🛋️

Habitare is a modern Design Marketplace designed to bridge the gap between architectural inspiration and the final purchase. Traditionally, design content generates high interest on platforms like Pinterest, but that "purchase desire" is often lost when users have to find products manually. Habitare solves this by turning content into a transactional platform.
